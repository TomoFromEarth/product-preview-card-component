## My process

I opted for a mobile-first approach for this project.  I found the majority of this project fairly easy to layout (wether or not my code looks nice is a different story), but the button was a pain so any input on how to deal with that is always welcome.

I used a media query and used the smallest point the desktop layout could go as the breakpoint which was 785px.

This was pretty straightforward and I am always happy to get pointers from others...

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I need to study buttons more!
